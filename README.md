# Introduction
We have a total of 9 robot chassis for choice. They are made of green aluminum alloy, beautiful and durable. Equipped with 520 motor with encoder, which provides a strong power for the car. Each aluminum alloy accessory is designed with screw copper column holes with reasonable spacing. Users can install main control board, lidar, camera, display screen and other equipment by themselves. We provide 3D model files of each chassis for free, and users can use them for their own projects.
# Features
* 9 kinds of chassis for choice
* Mecanum wheel chassis: 65mm and 80mm Mecanum wheels are used respectively to achieve 360Â° omnidirectional movement.
* Crawler chassis: Large size high-quality crawlers and motor with encoder(1:56) can be used to realize cross-country with complex terrain.
* Pendulous suspension chassis: The exquisite pendulum suspension structure is adopted, so that the four wheels of the car can contact the ground regardless of any terrain, effectively preventing wheel slip, and can adapt to different terrain.
* Chassis with robotic arm: Different degrees of freedom can be selected according to the demand, which can realize object clamping and handling.
